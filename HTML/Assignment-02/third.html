    <br> <b>&emsp;&ensp; Semantic Elements </b><br>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Semantic elements in HTML play a crucial role in enhancing the structure and meaning of
        web documents. The word
        semantic means <b><i>"relating to meaning"</i></b> These
        elements provide a clear and meaningful structure to both browsers and developers, aiding in accessibility and
        search engine optimization.&lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are not semantic elements.<br><br>


        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the fundamental semantic elements is the &lt;header&gt;. It typically includes
        information such as
        headings, logos,
        and navigation menus, signaling the beginning of a section or page. Proper use of the &lt;header&gt; element not
        only
        organizes content but also assists screen readers in providing users with a concise overview of the page's
        structure. <br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Another essential semantic element is the &lt;article&gt;. This tag encapsulates content
        that can be considered
        an
        independent, self-contained unit. Whether it's a blog post, news article, or a forum post, wrapping
        related content in the &lt;article&gt; tag promotes clarity and assists search engines in understanding the
        context and relevance of the enclosed information. <br>
    </p>

    <b>&emsp;&emsp;Why Use Semantic Elements?</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Accessibility:</b>
            Semantic elements contribute significantly to web accessibility. They provide a clear and meaningful
            structure to
            content, aiding users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies. For instance, the proper
            use of
            semantic tags helps in creating well-organized content that
            can be easily navigated by individuals with disabilities. Screen readers interpret these tags,
            allowing users to understand the hierarchy and relationships between different sections of a
            webpage. By using semantic elements, developers ensure that their websites are inclusive and
            accessible to a broader audience.</li><br>

        <li><b>SEO</b>
            Search engines rely on the structure and semantics of HTML to understand and index web content
            accurately. Semantic elements provide context and meaning to the information on a webpage,
            making it easier for search engines to determine the relevance of the content to user queries.
            Properly structured content using semantic tags can positively impact a website's search engine
            ranking.
            the concluding section helps search engines identify and prioritize key pieces of
            information, ultimately improving the website's visibility in search results.</li><br>

        <li><b>Easy to Understand:</b>
            Semantic elements enhance the readability and maintainability of code, making it
            easier for developers to understand and collaborate on projects. When semantic tags
            are used appropriately, the HTML code reflects the logical structure of the content,
            making it self-explanatory. This not only facilitates smoother collaboration among
            development teams but also aids in the debugging and maintenance processes.
            Developers can quickly grasp the purpose of different sections within a document,
            leading to more efficient coding practices and a more sustainable codebase.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>&emsp;&emsp; Many wesb sites contain HTML code like: <b>&lt;div>&lt;div id="header" &gt; , &lt;div id="nav" &gt;
        ,&lt;div id="main" &gt; ,&lt;div id="footer" &gt;</b> to indicate header ,navbar,main and footer component.
